# MSBD566 - Predictive Modeling and Analytics
This repository contains **Assignment 1** for the MSBD566 course.  
The assignment demonstrates data exploration and analysis of Nashville’s **Air Quality Index (AQI)** and **pollen data** using Python.

---

## Assignment Overview

### Part 1 – Pandas
1. **AQI Analysis**
   - Plot AQI over time  
   - Plot AQI Categories by year (stacked bar)  
   - Count how many times AQI > 120  
   - Identify dates when AQI reached *Unhealthy or worse*  

2. **Pollen Analysis**
   - Find which pollen type occurs the most  
   - Visualize pollen frequency with bar charts and scatterplots  

3. **Comfort Evaluation (Open-ended)**
   - Discuss if Nashville is comfortable to live in based on air quality and pollen  

4. **Vectorization Problem**
   - Compare manual loop vs. vectorized `groupby().mean()`  
   - Measure time difference and evaluate efficiency  

### Part 2 – GitHub Practice
- Created repository `MSBD566`  
- Uploaded notebook, dataset, and README  
- Practiced version control and documentation
